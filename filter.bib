Undoubtedly, cities have a high level of complexity, especially considering problems related to obtaining suitable information about a building's energy performance and consumption. This study developed a methodology able to characterize the energy performance of the built environment in a city or neighbourhood and to evaluate the effects of different energy strategies. The methodology was designed to be as simple as possible, not time consuming and applicable to all Italian towns, as well as elsewhere, if basic building information are available; the main phases of the methodology were the collection and analysis of the available data about the built environment and the implementation of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) city buildings database. To test the developed tool, the city of Milan was considered as a case study. The authors hope that this methodology will be able to support energy policies at the urban level, taking into account the approaches of different stakeholders to develop low carbon models of settlements.},

The methodology described in this paper is largely based on information that is already available on building stock (i.e., cartographic documentation, thematic maps, geometric data and others). Data regarding the energy performance of buildings are collected using energy audits on sample buildings, which are selected using a statistical approach. Using the tools in a 5GIS6 platform, the integration of two data sources allows for a low cost, comprehensive framework of the energy performance of buildings. This methodology was tested in a medium sized town in the Lombardy region (Italy), and the results are discussed in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Successful strategies towards minimizing the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the building sector require knowledge on the energy-related characteristics of the existing building stock. Despite the numerous studies on energy conservation applications in buildings, current knowledge on the energy-related characteristics of the building stock still remains limited. Building typologies can be a useful instrument to facilitate the energy performance assessment of a building stock. This work is based on a harmonised structure for European building typologies (TABULA) developed for residential buildings, but the methodology may be extended to the tertiary sector as well. National typologies are sets of model buildings with characteristic energy-related properties representative of a country's building stock. The model buildings are used as a showcase for demonstrating the energy performance and the potential energy savings from typical and advanced energy conservation measures (ECMs) on the thermal envelope and the heat supply system. The proposed Hellenic residential building typology is presented for the first time along with an assessment of various (ECMs) that are used for an estimate of the energy performance of building stock in Greece in an effort to meet the 9{\%} indicative national energy savings target by 2016.},

  Abstract                 = {District heating can provide cost-effective and low-carbon energy to local populations. Although this is rare in the UK, Sheffield already has an award-winning district energy network. It has been previously determined that this could be expanded to incorporate new heat sources and sinks. This paper determines the environmental and socio-economic impacts, focussing on various fuels. Combined-heat-and-power generation in Sheffield coupled with sustainable/renewable fuels, like waste, offer high efficiencies ({\&}gt;77{\%}) and consistently lower carbon emission factors (0.04--0.14 kg/MJ) than conventional energy generation using fossil fuels, since up to 80{\%} of the fuel-carbon is biogenic (CO2-neutral). Processing municipal waste into a refuse-derived fuel prior to combustion or lowering the return-water temperature by 35 °C in the district heating network could further improve efficiencies (81--93{\%}) and reduce CO2 emission rates by 4 t/h for the Sheffield plant, increasing avoided emissions from 69,000 t/a to 80,000--91,000 t/a. Moreover, ways in which the energy supply could be further decarbonised were identified, as well as methods to minimise the impacts of responding to changes in demand. Though initial costs of such schemes are high, they can be economically-viable for the investor/operator and consequently offer competitive rates for customers. Financial support is also available through government-backed schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {District heating can provide cost-effective and low-carbon energy to local populations, such as space heating in winter and year-round hot/cold water; this is also associated with electricity generation in combined-heat-and-power systems. Although this is currently rare in the UK, many legislative policies, including the Renewable Heat Incentive, aim to increase the amount of energy from such sources; including new installations, as well as extending/upgrading existing distributed energy schemes. Sheffield already has an award-winning district energy network, incorporating city-wide heat distribution. This paper aimed to demonstrate the opportunities for expansions to this through geographical information systems software modelling for an in-depth analysis of the heat demands in the city. `Heat maps' were produced, locating existing and emerging heat sources and sinks. Heat loads (industrial, commercial, educational, health care, council and leisure facilities/complex) total 53 MW, with existing residential areas accounting for $\sim$1500 MW and new housing developments potentially adding a further 35 MW in the future. A number of current and emerging heat sources were also discovered -- potential suppliers of thermal energy to the above-defined heat sinks. From these, six `heat zones' where an expansion to the existing network could be possible were identified and the infrastructure planned for each development.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Climate change has a dual implication on the built environment: on one hand human settlements and buildings are vulnerable to the effects of changing climate and on the other hand the building sector has a significant climate change mitigation potential. The relevant sustainable development and building policies as well as the building design, construction and maintenance strategies should jointly respond both to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. What should city developers focus on in order to plan a sustainable and safe city in a changing climate? This paper provides answers to this question, presenting a bottom-up methodology based on a generalized building typology of the residential building stock in order to estimate the mitigation potential and vulnerability of the residential sector. During the research, a case study has been implemented in Hungary to assess the structural impacts and vulnerability on the roof, particularly with respect to the wind load and to estimate the potential decrease of 5CO26 emission through refurbishment. Through the case study the paper highlights the most problematic areas of the city both from vulnerability and mitigation point of view where the attention of the city developers should be turned.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to present two Danish typologies for residential buildings developed in the EU-financed project TABULA. The building typologies focus on energy performance and can be used in the analyses of e.g. political strategies for planning the future upgrading of the energy performance of the residential building stock. Overall, the typologies consist of two types of building models - real example models and average designed models. Based on buildings selected from the database of the Danish Energy Performance Certificate Scheme, real example models were established that were found to be good representatives, which had not yet been through any major energy upgrading (except windows and doors), since they were erected. These real example model buildings can be used to promote energy-saving potential to homeowners. Another main purpose of developing the building typologies was to establish a tool able to calculate different energy-saving scenarios for the entire residential building stock. To make such calculations of scenarios, similar average designed building models were established based on extracted average values from the Danish Energy Performance Certification Scheme database. The two building typologies had the same overall composition, i.e. three main building types: Single-family houses, terraced houses and blocks of flats. Each main building type is presented for nine periods representing age, typical building tradition and insulation levels. Finally, an energy balance model of the residential building stock was devised to validate the average designed building models. Compared with the official statistics on energy consumption in Denmark 2010, the results showed a difference below 4{\%}, making it an applicable tool for scenario analyses of an upgraded energy performance of the Danish building stock.},

  Abstract                 = {The path towards energy sustainability is commonly referred to the incremental adoption of available technologies, practices and policies that may help to decrease the environmental impact of energy sector, while providing an adequate standard of energy services. The evaluation of trade-offs among technologies, practices and policies for the mitigation of environmental problems related to energy resources depletion requires a deep knowledge of the local and global effects of the proposed solutions. While attempting to calculate such effects for a large complex system like a city, an advanced multidisciplinary approach is needed to overcome difficulties in modeling correctly real phenomena while maintaining computational transparency, reliability, interoperability and efficiency across different levels of analysis. Further, a methodology that rationally integrates different computational models and techniques is necessary to enable collaborative research in the field of optimization of energy efficiency strategies and integration of renewable energy systems in urban areas. For these reasons, a selection of currently available models for distributed generation planning and design is presented and analyzed in the perspective of gathering their capabilities in an optimization framework to support a paradigm shift in urban energy systems. This framework embodies the main concepts of a local energy management system and adopts a multicriteria perspective to determine optimal solutions for providing energy services through distributed generation.},

  Abstract                 = {Built environment is responsible for 60{\%} of total energy consumption in European countries and 128 million 5BOE6 of primary energy in Belgium. The average energy consumption in the residential buildings of Belgium is 70{\%} higher than the 5EU6 average and stands at 348~kW~h/m2/year. Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) provides guidelines for energy performance analysis of buildings in Belgium. In this study, a holistic approach has been adopted to analyse the building stock of Liege, Belgium. This analysis is based on `General Socio-economic survey 2001' and `Housing quality survey 2006 in Walloon region' databases. It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69{\%} of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.},
