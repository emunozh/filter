\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a method to allocate heat demand of residential
buildings in space. The buildings and their characteristics are available from
the city digital cadaster.\\

Based on the building characteristics an appropriate \textit{building type} is
selected. In Germany the use of building typologies for the estimation of heat
demand is a common practice. Nonetheless, this practice requires the user to
make a subjective decision regarding the choice for a type of building. In
this paper we present a method to automatically determinate the building type
given some characteristics of the buildings and a pre-defined typology. This method
allows us to: (1) systematically compare results of different building
typologies; (2) process large amount of building data from a digital cadaster
without binding the method to the cadaster data structure, making the method
transferable to other cities with a digital cadaster; and (3) because the
nature of our method is stochastic, we are able to represent not only the best
estimate of heat demand but the corresponding uncertainty level of the area and
of the typology.  \\

We expect to expand this method for the use of urban typologies able to
estimate and allocate heat demand of urban morphologies without the need of a
digital cadaster, expanding so the accessibility to this method to a global
scale.\\

The presented results in this paper have shown that: (1) national typologies
under estimate heat demand of the single buildings in the selected urban area,
while typologies developed for specific regions over estimate heat demand of
the same urban area; (2) national typologies perform better at an aggregated
level, while regional typologies perform better at a micro level (3) an
identification of ``hot spots'' in small urban areas is possible.  (4) for a
comprehensive identification of retrofit areas in urban spaces we need to
integrate: (a) the tertiary sector and (b) possible heat sources that can
supply the demand of these ``hot spots''.
